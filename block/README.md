After a short inspection, I noticed that this script seemed to do some sort of block cipher with a key lenght of 3 bytes. Since the data is encrypted once with key1 and then a second time with key2, it would seem that this increased the keylength the 6 bytes. Unfortuantly the only way to break a cipher like this is through brute forcing and 6 bytes would take too long.

This cipher is vulnerable to a Meet in the Middle attack. This means that in 2\*(16\*\*6) times we can break this cipher instead of 16\*\*12. This attack works by encrypting a plain-text with every key in the keyspace and storing those in a table. You then decrypt the matching cipher-text with every possible key until you collide with a value in your table.

```python
import block

table = {}
for key_forward in range(16**6):
    middle_for = block.encrypt_data("message: ", key_forward).encode('hex')
    table[middle_for] = key_forward
    if key_forward % 100000 == 0:
        print key_forward

for key_backward in range(16**6):
    middle_back = block.decrypt_data("\x38\xB3\x89\x25\x3A\x84\x89\x7A\xBD", key_backward).encode('hex')
    if key_backward % 100000 == 0:
        print key_backward
    if middle_back in table:
        print "SOLUTION!!!!"
        print key_backward
        print table[middle_back]
```
